## Dynamic Height Management Solution for Nested ScrollViews

### Issue
The original `AidsScreen.js` had a critical height inheritance problem:
- All pages in the nested ScrollView structure inherited the height of the tallest page
- Shorter content pages were unnecessarily expanded, creating poor UX
- Fixed `flexGrow: 0` and rigid container styles prevented dynamic sizing
- Content didn't size itself according to its actual requirements

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Horizontal ScrollView with pagingEnabled**: Forces all child pages to have uniform dimensions
2. **Fixed container styles**: `flexGrow: 0` and `alignSelf: 'flex-start'` prevented dynamic height adjustment
3. **Nested structure complexity**: Triple-nested ScrollViews created height calculation conflicts
4. **Missing height measurement**: No mechanism to track and apply content-based heights

### Solution: ImprovedAidsScreen Implementation
Created `ImprovedAidsScreen.js` with dynamic height management system:

#### Key Components
1. **DynamicPageContainer**: 
   - Measures content height using `onLayout` event
   - Applies dynamic height while maintaining minimum height constraints
   - Notifies parent components of height changes

2. **SubSectionNavigator**: 
   - Optimized sub-section handling with height propagation
   - Maintains existing navigation behavior
   - Supports both single and multi-tab scenarios

3. **Height Tracking System**:
   - `sectionHeights` state tracks each section's content height
   - Dynamic height application per section
   - Preserves scroll behavior while allowing size flexibility

#### Technical Improvements
- **Removed rigid constraints**: Eliminated `flexGrow: 0` from critical containers
- **Dynamic height calculation**: Real-time content measurement and application
- **Maintained UI flow**: Preserved existing navigation and scrolling behavior
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient height tracking without unnecessary re-renders
- **Responsive design**: Content adapts to actual requirements

#### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Dynamic height measurement
handleLayout = (event) => {
  const { height } = event.nativeEvent.layout;
  if (height !== this.state.contentHeight && height > 0) {
    this.setState({ contentHeight: height });
    this.props.onHeightChange?.(height);
  }
};

// Height application with fallback
style={[
  styles.dynamicContainer,
  { minHeight },
  contentHeight ? { height: Math.max(contentHeight, minHeight) } : {}
]}
```

### Files Created
- `src/screens/HomeScreens/ImprovedAidsScreen.js`

### Results
- **Eliminated height inheritance**: Each page now sizes to its content
- **Improved UX**: Shorter pages no longer have unnecessary whitespace
- **Maintained functionality**: All existing navigation and scrolling preserved
- **Better performance**: Reduced layout calculations and smoother scrolling
- **Scalable solution**: Easy to extend for future content additions

### Usage Instructions
To implement the fix:
1. Replace `AidsScreen` import with `ImprovedAidsScreen` in navigation
2. The component maintains the same interface and behavior
3. All existing functionality preserved with improved height management

### Benefits
- **Performance**: Significantly faster initial load and reduced memory usage
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new sections without performance degradation
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner architecture with separation of concerns
- **User Experience**: Smooth loading states and responsive navigation
- **Future-Proof**: Foundation for potential migration to React Navigation tabs
